    <h4 class="aboutLabels">Why I bothered making this website:</h6>
        <p class="aboutPar">The main reason I wanted to create this website was to force myself to 
        learn the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. Having prior knowledge in C++ programming from
        a few courses I took at JuCo, I wanted to expand beyond back-end development languages so that I could
        one day be a full-stack developer. I still have a lot to learn, but I'm willing to do what
        it takes.</p>
    <h4 class="aboutLabels">Current goals:</h4>
        <p class="aboutPar">My biggest short-term aspiration right now is securing an internship for summer of 2025.
        I see this as the best way to develop skills to begin an actual career in the field.
        Long-term, I want to create something. I want to develop some service, whether software, hardware, or both,
        that changes either the world for the better and solves an everyday problem. I chose 
        computer engineering because of its versatality in learning programming but also its ability
        to familiarize me with more technical and tangible things. </p>
